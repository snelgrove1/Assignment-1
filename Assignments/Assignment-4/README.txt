#Question 2
For the .CSV file, I downloaded the data from the website. THen I deleted all the data in coloums
B,C,G,H,J,K,L. Then I moved the data from coloumns E,F and I to B,C and D. I then save the
new file as a .csv file. 



Assignment was due during exam time. Didn't have time to do it with all the
studying and course work due in the final week of classes. Had an exam the day before this
was due. 

I tried.
