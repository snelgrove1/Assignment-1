LECTURE 1
Very basic commands on UNIX, such as pwd, ls, cd, ., and ..
-a is print all
-F is a flag that modifies the commands behavior (adds a / behind files)



LECTURE 2 (Good for creating sorted direcotires)
Mo0re basic commands such as:
mkdir, nano, rm, rmdir (must be empty), mv, cp, *, wc (wordcount), >, cat, sort
-s      shows the size
-h      for human friedly output (number of bytes)
*       wild card matches zeor or more characters (*.pdg matches all files with .pdb)
           ---> for word count can also use -l for lines, -w for words or -c for characters
>       with word count will create a file that stores the value for a wc
cat     will  conCATenate files
head -1 will get the first line of a file 
|       is a pipe, will take one thng and have it produce dsoemthing else



LECTURE 3 (Midterm important?)
chmod, ;, man, find, ' ',
grep    find and prints lines ina  file that match  a pattern
not     every letter matches itself?? lots of grep combinations.



LECTURE 4 (Looping)
echo, >> (apending), 1> (stdout), 2> (stderr), &>, zip
$      replaces variable name with value before program runs
=      use this to create a new variable



LECTURE 5 ignore....



LECTURE 6
Sarts with the quiz
Version COnrol and Git (No codeing)
Rest of the lecture is useless/



LECTURE 7 (HOW TO USE GIT)
Not important for Midterm



LECTURE 8 (More git stuff)



LECTURE 9 (Python Basics)
THings to put in Python first line  (NumPy, SciPy Library, Matplotlib, IPython)
You can start with ipython
print(additon), nano simple.py, = (variables)



LECTURE 10 (Loops and While, lists)
Basic Arithmatic (+, -, *, /, **, %)
+=,%=, ==, <, !=, >=
while, print, if, elif, else, del .append, .insert, range



LECTURE 11(important)
how to read and open text files in python\
strings



LECTURE 12
alias - assigning one variable to another variable
append - revalue a variable by recalling it.
FUNCTIONS
def - defining a variable
if, elif else
If a funcition doesn't returna value, it returns None
Appender



LECTURE 13 Midterm Writtten Portion only



Lecture 14
Assigning values to other variables in a funtion
Higher order functions 
using * in functions
SLide 61 for flitering, mapping and reducing functions
SLide 70+ is libraries
Commands for importing Useful tools in python
import filename
help(filename)
from filename import stuff as thing
from math import *
read lines in a file
logical indexing



LECTURE 15 Arrrrrayyysss
Indexing in terms like [1:3]
Numpy (n-dimensional array, linear algebra, fourier transform, random number capabilities
Numpy arrays



LECTURE 16 Arrays again.
things to add to an array
how to make a largearray like 2x3 or 5x2
reshape, copy, filling an array, tolist, tostring, fromstring, fill, tanspose, flatten
concatenate (combine multiple arrays into one)



LECTURE 17 More Array work
np.arange
np.zeros & np.ones (1 or 0 arrays)
nbp.identity (identity matrix)
np.floor & np.ceil will round a decimal up or down
np.rint round to closest value
Array iteration



LECTURE 18 Turples 
This involves using () instead of ()
How t make functions return multiple values
enumerate produces (index,value) pairs     Number off a list easily (SLide 53)
Text...kinda useless



LECTURE 19 
datatype sizes. Not too sure abouyt it



LECTURE 20
using sets. they are unorganized
Things you can do with sets: See SLid 38 for full list of options
-add (add an element)
-clear (removes all elements)
-difference(odds)      
-intersection          
-issubset              
-issuperset
-remove 
Slide 46+ is about opening and reading files



LECTURE 21
sets and dictionaries
